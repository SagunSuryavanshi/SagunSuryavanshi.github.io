# Hi, I’m Sagun 👋

## Who Am I?

I’m a consumer PM with a TPM backbone, obsessed with building products that combine **deep user empathy** with **scalable, data-informed decisions**.

For me, it’s all about people:
- empowering teams and amplifying their ideas  
- listening closely to users and the problems they trust us to solve  
- making complexity feel simple and navigable

## What I’m Doing Now

### TPM @ Experian  
I coordinate **40+ teams** across fraud, data, and mainframe-to-cloud migrations—  
keeping timelines on track, fixing handoffs, and making progress easy to see.
