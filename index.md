    <h1>Hi, I'm Sagun 👋</h1>

    <p>
      I’m a consumer PM with a TPM backbone, obsessed with building products that combine
      <strong>deep user empathy</strong> with <strong>scalable, data-informed decisions</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s all about people for me: empowering teams, amplifying their ideas, and listening closely
      to users and the problems they trust us to solve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, I’m a TPM at <strong>Experian</strong>, coordinating 40+ teams across fraud, data,
      and mainframe-to-cloud migrations—keeping timelines on track, fixing handoffs, and making
      progress easy to see.
    </p>

    <p>
      Previously, I’ve worked across marketing, product, and engineering at Venture Docx, Skyhive,
      Vimana, Next Tech, and Guvi.
